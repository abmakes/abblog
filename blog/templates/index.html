        <p>...and we're off.</p>

        <p>Today started off a bit slowly with me fumbling through attempts to create a blog as quickly as I can. Tried github pages with Jekyll, but I didn't want to install Ruby. Tried Gatsby, but I'm not proficient enough with react yet and attempting to modifying themes was tedious. Last chance to pull it off, go back to what you know. I built this simple page using Django, HTML and CSS. Deployed it on Heroku.</p>

        <p>Tomorrow I will work on fetching blog posts from github using the github api, maybe try add some finess to the page. I am not looking to make this site too complex. I just want a place to share my thoughts and document my journey.</p>
